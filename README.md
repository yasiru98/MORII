# MORII

## Problem
Memories and their meaning fade away as time passes. 
How can we preserve these important memories for both people who communicate verbally and non-verbally?

## Solution

## Primary Goals
Create a space for users to hold memories and the feelings associated with them in a collaborative space.
Enable users to overcome communication barriers by visually representing stories that may otherwise go untold. 

## Secondary Goals
Connect users in their shared experiences and allow for memories to evolve from multiple perspectives.
Provide a method for processing emotions and further understanding ourselves as people.
